# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Summary
For this project, I had to create a quiz application with a timer using HTML, CSS, and mostly, Javascript.  

## How it Works
Open in Browser. A user has an option to play the game, or view high scores.  Once "Play" is clicked, user will run through a 5 question quiz, and will have to do so in 60 seconds.  The timer starts when the user clicks "Play".  A progress bar on the top left will show which question the user is on.  If the player chooses a wrong choice, the timer will decrease by 5 seconds.  Once the quiz is finish, the user is asked to save their name.  Once saved, the user is directed the "High Scores" page, where they can view the leaderboard.

Screenshots and a movie file are references to how it works.
